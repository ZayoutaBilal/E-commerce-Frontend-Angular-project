      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Zayouta shop started as a small online boutique in 2024, driven by a love
        for unique and accessible fashion. We saw a gap in the market for stylish
        clothing that didn't break the bank, and we set out to fill it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, we've expanded our collections, working with talented
        designers and ethical manufacturers to bring you the latest trends.
        We're proud to be a part of your fashion journey.
